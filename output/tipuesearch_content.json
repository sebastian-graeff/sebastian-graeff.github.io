{"pages":[{"title":"About","text":"Hey everyone! I'm Sebastian, I started this blog to showcase my journey through the world of data. I started programming in Python in September 2017, when I started the \"Intro to Programming\" course on Udacity. Since then I decided to plunge into data and am currently enrolled in term 2 of Udacity's \"Data Analysis\" course. On this blog I want to showcase what Im currently working on, be it projects or learning about new packages. In addition, I hope other beginners in Data Analysis can benefit from this blog too.","tags":"pages","url":"pages/about.html"},{"title":"First Post! - Confidence Intervals","text":"This post details my first experiences working with confidence intervals and other beginner statistics. Stay tuned for further posts and information on my journey through DATA. Confidence Intervals In [22]: import pandas as pd import numpy as np import matplotlib.pylab as plt The example: A teacher teaches a math classes. The average score on a math test is 60%, with a standard deviation of 15%. The teacher gives a sample group of 30 pupils apples before the lesson starts. The math test for the sample group has an average score of 68%. He wants to calculate with a 95% confidence interval (or we can say a alpha level of 0.05) if he can give apples to the whole class to improve math scores. My null ($H_0$) and alternative ($H_1$) hypothesis: $$ H_0: \\mu = 60% $$$$ H_1: \\mu â‰  60% $$ STEP 1: Find the critical value The critical value is the value that splits the graph into acceptable and non-acceptable values, so if we have a 95% confidence interval we have to take 5% of the tails, and in a two tailed test we take 2.5% off each tail. We can use a z-table to find these values, here is a link to one of these tables. So from this table we find that a value of 0.025 to the left side has a critical value of -1.96 and 1.96 to the right side. STEP 2: Find the standard error (this is the standard deviation of the sample) To find the standard deviation of a sample we use the formula: $$ s=\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} $$ Where $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the population and $n$ is the number of samples $$ s=\\frac{15}{\\sqrt{30}} $$ This gives us: $s=2.74$ STEP 3: Find the confidence intervals LOWER BOUND $= 68 + (-1.96\\times2.74) = 62.6$ UPPER BOUND $= 68 + (1.96\\times2.74) = 73.4$ STEP 4: Find the probability that sample values are smaller or larger than the population mean We first have to find the z-score to find this probability, the z-score is the number of standard deviation a value is from the mean. $$ zscore = \\frac{\\bar{\\mu}-\\mu}{s} $$ Where $\\mu$ is the population mean, $\\bar{\\mu}$ is the sample mean and $s$ is the standard error $$ zscore = \\frac{68-60}{2.74} $$ This gives us a z-score's of 2.92, which we can then look up on the z-table. The z-table gives us a probability of 0.9982 of getting sample means higher than our population mean and 0.0018 (because 1 - 0.9982) of getting sample means lower than our population mean. This tells us that (almost) all pupils in the sample group better results than the average score of the population. In the below graph we can see this more clearly. Now we can simulate the graph In [23]: gpop = [] gsample = [] # Generate 10000 random numbers given the mean and deviation of the population and sample for _ in range ( 10000 ): pop = np . random . normal ( 60 , 10 ) # The first argument is the mean of the population and the second is the deviation sample = np . random . normal ( 68 , 1.83 ) # The first argument is the sample mean and the second is the standard error gpop . append ( pop ) gsample . append ( sample ) In [27]: lower_bound = 62.6 upper_bound = 73.4 pop_mean = 60 plt . hist ( gnull , color = 'gainsboro' , label = 'Population' ) plt . hist ( gsample , color = 'royalblue' , label = 'Sample' ) plt . axvline ( x = lower_bound , c = 'r' ) plt . axvline ( x = upper_bound , c = 'r' ) plt . axvline ( x = pop_mean , c = 'g' ) plt . title ( \"Student test results\" ) plt . xlabel ( \"Test score (%)\" ) plt . ylabel ( \"Number of occurances\" ) plt . legend () plt . show (); From the above we see that the mean of the population ($\\mu=60$, the green line) does not fall into the bounds of our confidence interval (red lines), this tells us that we can reject the null in favour of the alternative. This also means that the teacher should adopt giving all students apples before teaching.","tags":"This site","url":"confidence-intervals.html"}]}
