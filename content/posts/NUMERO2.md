Summary: My second stats post!

Well this post is quite delayed. In the meantime I've been quite busy so I have only found time for another post now.

In this post I outline my further exploration into inferential statistics, specifically t-tests. I hope this can be of help to some people, who struggle with statistics concepts.

Stay tuned for further posts and information on my journey through DATA.
