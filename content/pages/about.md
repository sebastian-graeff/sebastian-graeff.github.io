Title: About

Hey everyone! I'm Sebastian, I started this blog to showcase my journey through the world of data. I started programming in Python in September 2017, when I started the "Intro to Programming" course on Udacity. Since then I decided to plunge into data and am currently enrolled in term 2 of Udacity's "Data Analysis" course.

On this blog I want to showcase what Im currently working on, be it projects or learning about new packages. In addition, I hope other beginners in Data Analysis can benefit from this blog too.
